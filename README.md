# x32-configs
> A collection of all our X32 configs and snippets.

## Installation

- Download the [latest Release](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/x32-configs/releases)
- Transfer the Scenes and Snippets you wish to use to your X32 either via X32-Edit or a USB stick.

## Development

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that our automated release tooling can properly analyze commits.
- Releases are made automatically whenever a `fix` or `feat` commit lands on `master`.
- All Scenes and Snippets should have `_dev` appended to the end of their names.
- The automated release tooling will replace `_dev` with the appropriate version number when publishing a release.
